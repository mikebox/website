Here’s a little about myself. I am a Senior Product Architect with a decade of experience, currently responsible for driving the architecture and strategic vision of a high-impact, million-dollar product. For the past 6+ years, I have been deeply involved in the development of this product, starting from scratch and building it into a robust and high-performing product. I lead a team of talented engineers in delivering innovative and reliable software.

My career began as a software engineer specializing in Magento for eCommerce development, where I gained hands-on experience in building Magento extensions and solving complex technical challenges. With time, my focus shifted towards product development, and I now take pride in my ability to identify and resolve intricate problems while ensuring the highest standards of performance and security.

I hold multiple Magento certifications as well as a Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certification. I am passionate about programming, continuously seeking to expand my knowledge and expertise in languages like PHP, Python, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React and Flask. My technical toolkit includes databases like MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Redis, along with Docker for containerization.

Driven by a love for technology, I approach my work with a deep commitment to innovation and excellence, striving to build product that not only meet today’s needs but are also prepared for tomorrow’s challenges.
